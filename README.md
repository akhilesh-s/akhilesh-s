### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Myself Akhilesh, I'm a software engineer with over 2 years of hands-on experience, I've cultivated a versatile skill set primed for tackling challenges across both frontend and backend development. 
My proficiency spans a range of technologies including TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Node.js, React.js, Next.js, MongoDB, and MySQL. Additionally, I boast a familiarity with cloud platforms such as GCP and AWS, enabling me to architect robust solutions tailored to modern infrastructure demands.
What truly ignites my enthusiasm in this field is not merely the mastery of programming languages, but rather the opportunity to tackle complex problems at scale and envision solutions that transcend immediate constraints. Whether it's optimizing performance, enhancing user experience, or architecting resilient systems, I thrive on the challenge of thinking at a macroscopic level.

I am actively seeking a new challenge that will not only allow me to further hone my craft but also contribute to impactful projects alongside like-minded professionals. If you're seeking a dynamic software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and a penchant for pushing boundaries, I am eager to explore how I can add value to your team.
